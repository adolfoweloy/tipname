This project is a Google Chrome extension that allows for the capability of loading an acronym data source to be used across pages in the browser.
Once the acronym data source is loaded (a file at the moment), it allows users to select a word in the text within a page and ask for a "translation" of the acronym.

The file used to load acronyms has to be a CSV file with the following format:

```
"acronym-1","meaning 1"
"acronym-2","meaning 2"
"acronym-n","meaning n"
```

At the moment I'm using vanilla JS for this project and the structure of this project is still open for improvement.
